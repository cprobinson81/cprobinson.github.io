* **Cyber Law: Past, Present, and Future**
  * Massachusetts Statewide Undergraduate Research Conference, University of Massachusetts Amherst
  * April 2018
  * **_Abstract:_** Laws based on cyber crimes are a new trend in government. What should be regulated online? Should people be held responsible for what they do or post? Can your first amendment rights be taken away online? How are you affected by laws today? These are questions that are brought up and debated when discussing cyber laws and policies. Starting with a historical view, we look back at why these policies needed to be put into place and how it plays a part in society. We also look at the history of hacking and how it plays a part in today. As we take a step towards the future, we consider new laws that could be put in place and the freedoms everyone should have. <br><br> We live in the age where these laws and policies are being defined. In 2017 alone we dealt with two major political problems, Net Neutrality and the Russian Hacking Scandal, that were in the spotlight and will shape the landscape of politics that surround issues on the internet. There are already laws in place that protect people rights on the internet, such as your credit card information, but there are only a certain few. Moving forward, we will use current issues that we face today to create possible laws for moving forward to the future. Within the next few years, cyber laws and policies will become a larger issue. Being prepared and on this issue will be important when attempting to tackle laws surrounding the internet.
